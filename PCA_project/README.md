# PCA project

In this project we work with data about critical temperatures of superconductors. We making linear models and PCA to find out which factors is important for critical temperature of superconductors.  
  
In folder *data* you can find two `.csv` files with data from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00464/superconduct.zi). Description of the data is given [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data#) and in the report of the project. Also there is file `kernel_pca.RData` in the *data* folder because Kernel PCA analysis requires a lot of computional resources.  
In folder *report* you can find the file `report.rmd` with code for data analysis and report in `.html` format.
